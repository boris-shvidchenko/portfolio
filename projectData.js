        description: "This was one of the first projects that I built using React with the Next.js framework, where I wasn't following tutorials or courses to complete the work. This was built entirely from scratch and was a fun and rewarding learning experience. Furthermore, this game was built using Tailwind CSS 3.0." ,
        description2: "The primary goal for this project was to gain an understanding of basic API usage and data manipulation in a more complex development environment, whilst trying to keep UI/UX design principals in mind to ensure a clean and responsive build. The data was obtained from the Open Trivia Database, which offers a free to use database with an extensive selection of questions. Although I am far from being an expert web designer I had a great time experimenting with various design principals/techniques and I hope to apply, and improve on, what I've learned from this project to my other builds. Take a look and let me know what you think!",

        summary: 'A cafe website build.',
        description: "The main objective for this project was to focus on creating a clean and effective website that followed the fundamentals of web design, including: the use of white space, visual hierarchy, fonts, and color contrast. The idea was to create a fictional coffee shop/caf√© website that was simple in design yet responsive and user friendly no matter what device the website was viewed on. This was an enjoyable build that allowed me to experiment with various looks to see what worked (and what didn't). ",
