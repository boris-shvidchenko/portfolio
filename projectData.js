        description: "This was one of my first projects that I built using React with the Next.js framework, where I wasn't following tutorials or courses to complete the work. This was built entirely from scratch and was a fun and rewarding learning experience. Furthermore, this game was built using Tailwind CSS 3.0." ,
        description2: "The primary goal for this project was to gain an understanding of basic API usage and data manipulation in a more complex development environment, whilst trying to keep UI/UX design principals in mind to ensure a clean and responsive build. The data was obtained from the Open Trivia Database, which offers a free to use database with an extensive selection of questions. Although I am far from being an expert web designer I had a great time experimenting with various design principals and techniques, and I hope to apply, and improve on, what I've learned from this project in my other builds. Please take a look and let me know what you think!",
